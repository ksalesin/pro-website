		<p>As the guardian deity of a mountain shrine, Inari must recover shards of lost light scattered by an Ancient Evil and restore harmony to the land. Traverse a stunning landscape using Inari’s wit and agility in this unconventional platformer. Launch Inari off of environmental obstacles to cross vast distances without ever touching the ground. Inspired by simplistic Japanese design, every level presents an engaging world for all ages to explore and enjoy.</p>

		<p>Zhao Shen’s original score blends seamlessly with the beautiful graphics, giving rise to an immersive soundscape. Best experienced with headphones.</p>

		<p>Inari can be accessed for free through TestFlight. Please <a href="mailto:kas493@cornell.edu?">contact us</a> or sign up for our <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/WMFwMeDI5Atp3p5p1" target="_blank">email list</a> for an invitation to the game.</p>

		<p>Spectrum Studios is a team of six Cornell University students assigned to work together by our professor, Walker White, for an Advanced Game Design class. We spent many afternoons and late nights working on the game together in various classrooms across campus. At the annual Game Design Initiative at Cornell (GDIAC) Showcase, Inari was voted Most Polished and came in third for Audience Favorite.</p>

		<p>Spectrum Studios consists of Kate Salesin (Project Lead), Matthew Persons (Software Lead), Phillip Yan (Design Lead), Charles Lai (Developer), Julia Mei (Developer), and John Peng (Developer). The music for Inari was composed by Zhao Shen.</p>
