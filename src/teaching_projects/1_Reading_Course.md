description: "I designed and ran the graduate reading course in winter 2020 for Master's in Digital Arts students at Dartmouth. I wrote the syllabus and assignments, ran discussions, and arranged presentations from guest speakers. I strove to encourage curiosity in the students and build my repertoire of teaching skills by testing some interactive learning techniques."
