description: "For the Rendering Competition in the Rendering Algorithms class at Dartmouth, I extended our simple homework path tracer to simulate physically accurate polarization. My image shows clear diatoms viewed through a polarization light microscope, where the wavelength-dependent phase shifts caused by light passing through polarizers and waveplates create a vivid array of colors."
